## POS Taggers

POS taggers are available for English (en), Dutch (nl), French (fr), German (de). For each langauge, the scripts & necessary information is in the respective directory. You will find the following files in each directory:

- **inference.ipynb**: Contains code for directly running POS tagging on a piece of text using our pre-trained models.

- **fine_tune.ipynb**: Contains code for fine-tuning our models on your own annotated POS dataset. (Doesn't need to be the same tagset)

- **README.md**: Contains details about the data and the tagset for each language

For details about the models or downloading them directly, please check out the [Lettuce Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/pranaydeeps/lettuce-pos-taggers-6638e94c11063400f5796feb) on HuggingFace.
